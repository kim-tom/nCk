# nCk
I found that I can't implement n-choose-k for arbitary k using for-loop in C while I can do that with recursive function when I was walking Ueno Park on last Sunday. This is first time for me to implement algorithms in Lisp. Let me know if you can tell me more lispish programming.

## nCk.c
printing all nCk using for-loop and recursive function.

## nCk.lisp
printing all nCk using recursive function. You can run lisp file online as said in comments.

## rpn.c
printing all available Reverse Polish Notation using recursive function.(I want to implement same codes in Lisp someday!)
